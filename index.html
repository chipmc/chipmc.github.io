        <h1>Garage Parking Sensor Project Page</h1>
        
        <p>A simple project to build a garage parking sensor for a two-car garage.</p>
    
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
 
        <p>Let's face it, garages are simply not big enough.  There is always more you want to put into a garage than
        will fit and once you park your cars, things get tighter still.  To get the most out of this space, your car needs 
        to be parked correctly everytime.  That is what this little device seeks to do.  This is the second generation of 
        device I have used and I learned some things from my first go-round.  Before I share the current design, let me give
        a few lessons learned from the first:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Sensor - I started with the inexpensive SR-501 ultrasonic sensor I buoght from China for $5.  This was a mistake
            as these cheap sensors did not have adequate range and could not deal with the changing cross-section of the 
            car as it approached the sensor.</li>
            <li>Power - I thought about using once of those USB charger wall-warts to supply 5V to the circuit.  Turns out that
            there is a difference between a charging device an a regulated power source - who knew!</li>
            <li>Board - My first attempt was to solder the circuit to a breadboard-like perf board.  This was a real pain
            and it added to the size of the board.</li>
            <li>Placement - I wanted this sensor to be "in" the wall to make the installation neat.  Unfortunately, the walls
            in the garage did not allow for the sensor to be placed at the ideal bumper height.  You may want to check what
            is inside the walls before you commit to the project.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Bill of materials and approximate costs ~$100</h2>
        
        <p>I wanted this project to be something that would last, looked professional and functioned reliably.  You could save a
        lot of time and some cost be mounting your sensor "on" rather than "in" the walls but here is the bill of materials 
        for the approach I took.</p>
        
        <h3>Mounting hardware - $10:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One - Double outlet box - old construction - $2</li>
                <li>Three - Single outlet boxes - old construction - $3</li>
                <li>One blank double box nylon plate - $1</li>
                <li>Three blank single box nylong plates - $1.50</li>
                <li>Paint, spacking, sandpaper assuming you have some laying around the house- ~$3</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Circuit Board - $10 for three</h3>
        
        <p>I have designed a board for this project which I share on OSHPark under my username.  The EAGLE and GERBER files are
        also stored here.</p>
        
        <h3>Electronics - $66 </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arduino Pro Mini - 5V / 8 Mhz - $10</li>
                <li>40 Pin Header strip - $1.50</li>
                <li>Six 330 ohm resistors - $1.50</li>
                <li>One diode (I used a standard 4107 but schottkey may be more efficicent $0.25</li>
                <li>Two potentiometers (optional) for quick adjustment - $3</li>
                <li>Two Maxbotix LV-MaxSonar - EZ0 sensors - $50</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Power Supply - RadioShack 9V 500mA Wall Wart - $10</h3>
        
        <h3>Cabling - $5</h3>
            <uL>
                <li>One 3" Four conductor female - female ribbon cable - $0.25</li>
                <li>One 8' Four conductor female - female cable (custom made) - $1.00</li>
                <li>One 3' Six conductor cable with 6 pin female to 7 pin female (one blank slot) - $1.50</li>
                <li>One 10' Six conductor cable with 6 pin female to 7 pin female (one blank slot) - $2.00</li>
            </uL>
        <h2> Installation </h2>
        
        <p>I wont bore you with the obvioud details but here is a rough outline of the work to be done.  I selected a 
        site which had a nearby outlet and placed the double box and a single box at a heigh of about six feet
        centered on each parking space.  I then placed two single boxes below the first two and tried to get them as close
        to car bumper height as the garage wall would allow.  I had to open up the wall in between the left and right
        boxes so I could snake the wire across.  If you are skilled in fishing wires across 2-3 studs without doing this
        then you can save a lot of time. </p>

        </a>

        <p>Once I had the boxes in place, I created the custom cables using a Pololu crimper making sure to skip one 
        spot on the sensor end of the wire so the PW pin was unconnected and the BW pin was held high.  This enabled 
        the two sensors to be "chained" where one sensor pings and then signals the next to ping thereby avoiding 
        interferrence between the sensors.  The ability for these sensors to perform this chaining and the analog
        output of the sensor made for a much cleaner sketch without the need for any libraries.</p>
        
        <p>With everything connected, I programmed the board with the sketch provided here.  The only items you may
        need to tweak are the Max, Mid and MinDistance variables.  You can also put the potentiometers on the board
        and make manual adjustments to the MinDistance just un-comment that code in the void setup() section.</p>

        <p>lease feel free to look at the code, board design and my approach to the project and suggest improvements.
        I hope this project is helpful and I may come back to it based on your feedback.  I can also imagine some potential 
        improvements going forward such as - networking the sensor to report status and trigger events, temperature correction
        (currently done only on power-on, and power saving steps.</p>
